This program corresponds to the 5th project of the OpenClassrooms Python apps dev.

The program is designed to allow an user to ask for substitution for any common food ingredient 
they want to replace in order to have a healthier lifestyle. The program will use the openfoodfacts 
API and will allow the user to retrieve any past substitution they have done.
